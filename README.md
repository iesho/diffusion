In this project, I explore generative AI through the lens of diffusion models by coding my own implementation of solutions to the variance-preserving stochastic differential equation (SDE), as given in Song, 2021: Score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equationsy. I implement the Euler-Maruyama and predictor-corrector sampling methods to solve the reverse-time SDE. Images are generated after being trained on the FashionMNIST dataset, see "results" for examples of generated images.
